    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Our lab focuses on <strong>the molecular dynamics research of biological systems</strong>, especially development and application of force field parameters and protein structure and function. We have done many works in metal ions force field parameterization and metalloprotein MD simulations, protein crowded effect and so on. And we are also interested in enzyme mechanism, liquid-liquid seperation and molecular docking.</p><span id="more"></span>]]></content>
